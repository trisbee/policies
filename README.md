### Checklist

All the steps bellow should be approved by [Lenka](https://github.com/BubbleB7) (Legal & Compliance Manager)

- [ ] Create new TCs and keep in mind changing the date of validity
- [ ] Prepare a [notification e-mail](https://app.hubspot.com/email/8435474/edit/92797583531/settings) and define who should receive it
- [ ] Make changes [on the web](https://www.trisbee.com/terms) according to the new TCs
- [ ] Send a notification e-mail and publish web changes on the same date
- [ ] When the new TCs are "active", move the old TCs to the Archive (links to github commits [on the website](https://www.trisbee.com/terms))

### Best practice

Please always use `Merge pull request` button in [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request) than `Rebase` to keep correct dates on commits, because we are reading them on the company website.
