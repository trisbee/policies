**(2) Who processes your personal data?**
-----------------------------------------

Your personal data are primarily processed by Us as a Service provider
and administrator of personal data. In some cases, however, it is
necessary to make your personal data available to the extent necessary
to other entities who provide Trisbee with various services
(processors). The reason is to fulfill all our contractual and legal
obligations towards you, official authorities and other entities arising
out of the Trisbee activities or as a prevention and protection against
fraudulent payment transactions.

**(3) Why do We process your data?**
------------------------------------
<a name="why"></a>

A.  To provide you with the Services you have ordered. For example, when
We maintain a payment account for you, We work with data regarding
the transactions on such payment account. Such processing is
necessary to fulfill the contract with you.

B.  To provide our Services even if you are not our client. For example,
when our client sends money to your phone number, We will send a
message to your phone number with instructions on how to
accept payment. If you have this payment sent to your bank account,
We also work with this information. That is our legitimate interest.
As long as you are not our client, We do not associate a phone
number or a bank account number with your person.

C.  To promote and improve our Services. If you use our Services, We
want to inform you about news regarding our Services. You can
unsubscribe from receiving newsletters at any time. Promoting and
improving the Services is our legitimate interest.

D.  To protect our rights. Even if you are not our client, but you have
received a payment through our Service, We need to process and store
information about this transaction, for example, to avoid a dispute
with the client. That is our legitimate interest.

E.  To fulfill our legal obligations. For example, the legal obligation
to identify a user of our payment services as prevention and
protection against fraudulent transactions or to meet our accounting
and tax obligations.

**(4) How long will We process the data?**
------------------------------------------

We process your data for purpose (A.) until you cease to use the
Service. We process the data for the purpose (B.) for the time necessary
to provide the Service, usually until the completion of the transaction.
We process the data for purpose (C.) as long as our legitimate interest
persists or you (legally) refuse such processing. We process the data
for purpose (D.) as long as our legitimate interest persists or you
(legally) refuse such processing, but no longer than 5 years from your
last communication with Trisbee or from your last use of the Service, or
from receiving payment through the Service. We process the data for the
purpose (E.) as long as the legal obligation persists.

extent necessary to ensure our contractual and legal obligations, their
protection shall be ensured under the standard contractual clauses or
under the Privacy Shield Program (program for cooperation between EU and
USA) - for more information, see European Commission website or the
