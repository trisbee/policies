**3.1.1.**	Trisbee develops and operates software serving to payments acceptance, especially in the form of the Business Application, or in another form agreed between Trisbee and the Merchant (hereinafter referred to as **“Business Payment Methods”**). Trisbee also manages an API made available to the Merchant and enabling integration of software for payments acceptance by the Merchant. The Business Application and Business Dashboard serve the Merchant as a payment terminal.

**3.1.2.**	Trisbee grants to the Merchant a non-exclusive, non-transferable and gratuitous license to use the Business Application and the other Business Payment Methods, thus in accordance with these Business Terms and Conditions and, where applicable, also in accordance with the terms of the platform from which the specific software was downloaded. The license applies to all later versions of the software solution provided to the Merchant, unless a new license to use is provided together with the new version. 

**3.1.3.**	The Merchant may not independently distribute, publish or otherwise forward the Business Application to other persons; the Business Application is available for download via Google Play or the App Store.

**3.1.4.**	By downloading the Business Application, or by using other Business Payment Methods, the Merchant acknowledges that Trisbee thus gains access to certain information of the device on which the Merchant has installed their solution for payments acceptance or which they use their solution for payments on. This includes information such as IP address, name of the device, the operating system version, and geolocation. In some cases, Trisbee has access to the device information only if the Merchant enables this feature on the device.

**3.1.5.**	By downloading the Business Application or by using other Business Payment Methods designed for non-cash payment acceptance, the Merchant agrees to refrain from:
- performing of operations such as translation, adjustment, modification, circumvention, reverse engineering, decomposition, disassembly, creation of derivatives or other interventions into any feature of the Business Application or of the Business Payment Method, or assisting to another person in the above-described interventions;
- using the Business Application or the Business Payment Methods illegally, for illegal purposes, in a manner that is in violation of these Business Terms and Conditions, or treating the Business Application or the Business Payment Methods in a fraudulent or deceptive manner, such as hacking, inserting malicious code or malicious data into the Business Application or the specific Business Payment Method or into the operating system;

**3.1.6.**	The Merchant is responsible for securing of all their devices and for activating of all security features of access into the devices that they have the solution for payments acceptance installed on or that they use the solution for payments acceptance on, so that, without the Merchant’s consent and authorization, no third party can access the Business Payment Methods used (including the Business Application and Business Dashboard), to confidential data related to the provided payment services and to data on individual payment transactions in favor of the Merchant. Violation of these instructions may significantly impact settlement of any complaint about a payment service or a specific payment transaction filed by the Merchant.

**3.1.7.**	In the event that the contractual relationship between the Merchant and Trisbee is terminated, Trisbee recommends to the Merchant to remove the Business Application and all components of the Business Payment Methods from all the Merchant’s devices for security and protection reasons.

### 3.2. Acceptance of Payments by the Merchant

**3.2.1.**	The User may enter payment orders in favor of the Merchant, in particular using the User Application or another method offered by Trisbee to remit payments to the Merchant registered with Trisbee. 

**3.2.2.**	The user selects a specific Merchant in the Application either by searching in the list of Merchants or by scanning the Merchant’s QR code (see Article 2.3.7. of the Business Terms and Conditions).  After the payment amount is entered, the User selects a payment method (Payment Account, payment card, Apple Pay, Google Pay) and confirms t¨he transaction with the “Pay” button. The User thus completes the payment order.

**3.2.3.**	After the User enters an order to make a payment in the Application, the transaction is registered in the Trisbee system. Successful entering of a payment order is confirmed to the User in the Application and a unique transaction code is delivered thereto. In such a case, the Merchant is notified in the Business Application or in another way (such as by a text message) of the payment registration and, at the same time, of the identical unique transaction code.

**3.2.4.**	The Merchant acknowledges that upon their notification of the payment registration in their favor, the transaction is always reviewed for relevant provisions of the AML Act, i.e. it is always checked whether the transaction is not suspicious or a risky transaction in terms of possible fraud. 

**3.2.5.**	If the payment transaction is verified and it can be concluded that it is not a suspicious or risky transaction Trisbee or, where applicable, the payment service provider processes the User’s payment order and in accordance with Article 3.2.6. of these Business Terms and Conditions remits the relevant amount in favor of the Merchant’s (verified) bank account. Otherwise, ie. if the verification suggests that the payment transaction might be suspicious and/or risky, Trisbee shall proceed in accordance with Article 3.3. hereof. 

**3.2.6.**	Payments entered in favor of the Merchant are sent to the Merchant’s bank account; in doing so, the date of the payment remittance to the Merchant is directly dependent on the payment method chosen by the User. 

a)	The User’s payments from Trisbee Payment Account (where Trisbee is the payment service provider) are remitted by Trisbee to the Merchant on the next working day after successful receipt of the payment order from the User. Trisbee does not maintain any payment account for the Merchant.

b)	If Trisbee mediates a payment service (payments with a card, via Apple Pay, Google Pay, indirect entering of a payment order from a bank account), where the service in question is provided by an entity being in a contractual relationship with Trisbee, then the payments remittance to the Merchant is governed by the terms and conditions of the service provider. The Merchant is informed of the current terms and conditions when concluding an agreement on the mediation of the payment service with Trisbee.
 
### 3.3.	Suspicious and Risky Transactions

**3.3.1.**	In the event that Trisbee and/or the payment service provider, based on verification of a payment transaction entered in favor of the Merchant in accordance with Article 3.2.5. herein, concludes that the payment transaction is suspicious and/or risky (if there is a justified suspicion of fraud), 

(i)	**processing of the transaction is immediately blocked** and the transaction is not accepted for processing

or

(ii)	**processing of the transaction is immediately suspended**

and, at the same time,

(iii)	**Trisbee immediately contacts the User and/or the Merchant, requesting further information on the entered payment order and submission of supporting documents relating to the transaction**. Trisbee contacts these persons by phone and/or via SMS and/or e-mail, and may choose any or all of these methods in order to do its best to reach the person contacted as quickly as possible.

**The reason** for verifying of such an entered payment order (if the payment order is not blocked immediately) primarily consists in fulfillment of statutory obligations relating to Trisbee (as a mandatory payment institution) under the AML Act and in protection of legitimate interests of the company as an entrepreneur against fraud, whether committed against Trisbee or through Trisbee. **The purpose** of the verification is to obtain additional information and documents, on which Trisbee may base their decision on further processing of the entered payment order (if the payment order is not blocked immediately as set in paragraph (i) above) or rejection of the payment order.

**3.3.2.**	The Merchant acknowledges and understands that the decision to block acceptance of a payment order according to Article 3.3.1. (i) is final, in contrast to the interim decision on the suspension of a payment order acceptance according to 3.3.1. (ii), when the decision to (not) accept and (not) process the payment order depends on the cooperation as described below between the User and the Merchant. 

**3.3.3.**	The Merchant acknowledges and understands that Trisbee is entitled to request the User and/or Merchant to communicate thereto the facts and to provide thereto all relevant documents relating to the payment order entered by the User in the Application. Both the User and the Merchant are obliged to provide Trisbee with proper and timely cooperation. **Proper cooperation** means provision of complete, unbiased and truthful information and documents related to the verified payment transaction. **Timely cooperation** means cooperation provided without delay and no later than by the end of the 3rd working day after the day on which Trisbee demonstrably requested the cooperation of the person(s) concerned.

**3.3.4.**	In the event that the User and the Merchant jointly or separately remain out of contact or if they do not provide any information and documents or provide insufficient, distorted or misleading information and documents concerning the verified payment transaction by the deadline specified in the previous Art. 3.3.3. hereof, Trisbee may - as a result of such behavior - consider the verified payment transaction suspicious and risky.  In such a case, Trisbee is **entitled to refuse processing of the payment order entered by the payer**. The decision on refusal of the payment transaction mediation by Trisbee shall be notified without delay to the User and/or the Merchant. In such a case the payment shall not be remitted to the Merchant.

**3.3.5.** In situations where the User, or the Merchant provide complete, unbiased and true information and documents relating to the verified payment transaction by the deadline according to Art. 3.3.3. hereof, Trisbee shall decide without undue delay, based on assessment of all facts and documents as follows: 

(i)	**either to complete processing of the payment order entered by the User** so that the payment is sent to the Merchant, if the doubts about the payment transaction are dispelled based on the information and documents provided;

or

(ii)	**to refuse mediation of the payment transaction in question** if, based on the information and supporting documents provided, Trisbee concludes that the payment transaction is suspicious and/or risky. The decision on refusal of the payment transaction mediation by Trisbee shall be notified without delay to the User and/or the Merchant. In such a case the payment shall not be remitted to the Merchant.

**3.3.6.**	Trisbee proceeds similarly, mutatis mutandis with Articles 3.3.4. and 3.3.5. hereof, if after processing the User’s payment order it discovers facts providing grounds for considering of the payment transaction in question suspicious or risky. Trisbee is entitled to proceed as set in the previous sentence for 1 month upon the date that the User entered the payment order in question. In the event that the payment transaction in question is found to be suspicious or risky, Trisbee will cancel the payment transaction (chargeback) - if possible and necessary - doing so in accordance with the terms and conditions of the payment service provider.
 
### 3.4.	Complaints about Payment Transactions, Cancellations and Refunds

**3.4.1.**	If the Merchant thinks that a specific payment credited to the Merchant’s bank account does not correspond with the payment order entered by the User and with the sent notification, or that the Merchant has not received the payment entered by the User even though notified thereto, or that the Merchant has not received not even the notification of the payment they are persuaded the User entered for payment, the Merchant may complain about the payment transaction with Trisbee. 

**3.4.2.**	The Merchant is entitled to file a complaint about a specific payment transaction with Trisbee without undue delay after finding out about the reason for the claim, but no later than within 13 months from the day when the payment transaction was notified to the Merchant or, in absence of such a notification, within 13 months from the date that the payer placed the payment order in favor of the Merchant.

Trisbee always informs the Merchant that their complaint was received by Trisbee and when, that it was registered and that it will be settled within 1 month. If a complaint filed by the Merchant lacks data needed for verification of the claimed payment transaction, or if it is necessary that the Merchant clarifies certain facts or submits relevant documents, Trisbee contacts the Merchant in order to ensure completion of such facts and documents. In that case, the deadline for settling of a complaint may be adequately extended by the time period of waiting by Trisbee for communication of the required complementary facts and for documents indispensable for settlement of the complaint from the Merchant. If the Merchant does not communicate the complementary facts and/or does not provide indispensable documents to Trisbee within 1 month of a notice for completion delivered by Trisbee, without the User indicating the reason for such a delay and for requesting alternative deadline for communication and substantiation of complementary facts, Trisbee shall terminate the complaint procedure and shall notify the Merchant thereof.

**3.4.5.**	After examining all the facts and documents provided by the Merchant in re the filed complaint and/or the facts and documents from Trisbee’s internal records, Trisbee shall decide on settlement of the complaint by concluding that the complaint is either:

(i) **justified** and therefore shall comply with the complaint, ie shall inform the Merchant that their complaint is justified and shall immediately take all necessary actions leading to elimination of the claimed status of the payment transaction; these actions may vary depending on the nature of the complaint;

or

(ii) **unjustified** and therefore shall reject the complaint, ie shall inform the Merchant that their complaint has been found unjustified and shall indicate substantial reasoning of the decision;

or

(iii) **partially justified** and therefore shall comply with the complaint to a certain extent, ie shall inform the Merchant that their complaint is justified to a certain extent, shall specify the justified part of the complaint and shall immediately take all necessary actions leading to elimination of the reasonably claimed status of the payment transaction (specific actions may vary depending on the nature of the complaint).
