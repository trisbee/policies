**TRISBEE PERÚ S.A.C.**, with its registered office at Calle los Tulipanes No. 147, Interior 106, Urbanización Lima Polo Hunt, distrito de Santiago de Surco, provincia y departamento de Lima, RUC No. 20606944617
(hereinafter referred to as "**Trisbee**")

provides the Users with a cashback service (hereinafter referred to as "Cashback"), if the User, via the Trisbee application, purchases goods and services from registered Merchants. Cashback equals a specified percentage of the purchase price of goods and services and the specific percentage may be subject to further conditions, while the maximum amount of Cashback within a single purchase is also set - [see the limits in the table below](#cashback-limits). Cashback is displayed to the User in the Trisbee application. The provision of the Cashback service is not claimable, provided that the decision that the User has fulfilled the conditions of the service is entirely at the Trisbee sole discretion.

Trisbee will not credit Cashback to the User's payment account if the User has made a payment in his own favor or in favor of the Merchant, whose he/she is a statutory body of or with whom he/she is closely related. In the event of a refund of the purchase price of the goods or services to which the Cashback was credited to the User, regardless of the reason for the refund, Trisbee will deduct the relevant Cashback previously credited to the User.

The user is not allowed to make any payment transactions on behalf of someone else, or misuse another's identity or use a non-existent identity. The User is not allowed to take advantage of the Cashback offer solely for the purpose of crediting the Cashback and then cancel the purchase of goods or services, or otherwise abuse or circumvent the conditions for Cashback crediting to the User’s payment account. In the event of a breach of the rules or abuse of the service or even in case of a reasonable suspicion of a breach of the rules or abuse of the service, Trisbee has the right not to provide the service, and at the same time, Trisbee has the right to suspend or terminate the provision of the Trisbee payment service to the User.

These Cashback Terms and Conditions are directly linked to the User Terms and Conditions and are in effect until Trisbee notifies the termination of the provision of the service. At the same time, Trisbee reserves the right to unilaterally amend the Terms and Conditions of the service provided with effect from the day following the releasing of amendment to the Terms and Conditions on the Trisbee website or in the Trisbee application.
