For more information about processing and retention of the User data see the Trisbee Privacy Policy.

**2.3.2.** If identification of the User is a statutory condition for the provision of a payment service, Trisbee cannot provide the required payment services to the User without verifying his/her identity and other legally stipulated data concerning the User.

**2.3.3.** The identification procedure comprises:

(i) verification of the User&#39;s identity on the basis of data communicated thereby and identification documents submitted;

(ii) verification of existence of a bank account held in the name of the User; and

(iii) performing of a verification payment through the User&#39;s bank account as specified under (ii) above.

**2.3.4.** Trisbee will guide the User through the identification procedure either directly in the Application or via email messages containing relevant instructions and guidelines. In case of any confusion regarding the identification procedure, the User may use Trisbee customer support; the contacts are listed both in the Application and on [www.trisbee.com](http://www.trisbee.com/).

**2.3.5.** The identification is performed by Trisbee without undue delay, upon obtaining of the necessary data and documents from the User. Once the User&#39;s identification is completed, Trisbee shall decide whether the User shall be approved or not. The User is informed about the result of the performed identification either directly in the Application, or via an email message. The User&#39;s approval is non-compulsory and is always at the discretion of Trisbee, according to the specific circumstances of each individual User.

**2.3.6.** In justified cases, based on amendments to statutory requirements or as part of a regular or random inspection, Trisbee shall be entitled to perform the User&#39;s identification during the term of the contractual relationship. In such cases, the User shall be obliged to undergo the repeated identification, while the prior approval of the User has no effect on the result of the present identification.

**2.3.7.** Trisbee is entitled to decide on disapproval of the User, or on subsequent temporary ban on, termination or restriction of the use of the payment services by the User, in the event that:

(i) the User does not provide the information and documents required for identification by law;

(iii) on the basis of verification of all information and documents provided by the User, there may be reasonable doubts about veracity and authenticity of the facts and documents provided by the User or if Trisbee has reasonable doubts about credibility of the User;

(iv) the provision of payment services to the User might potentially cause damage to Trisbee, including both material (risk of financial loss, risk of liability for damage caused to business partners or third party, etc.) and non-material (risk of damage to Trisbee&#39;s reputation, risk of damage to business relations of Trisbee with third parties, etc.) harm;

(v) the provision of payment services to the User, or the execution of a specific payment transaction entered by the User, is not compatible with the moral, generally human or business values ​​which Trisbee insists on adhering to.

Trisbee shall notify the User of the reasons for the User&#39;s disapproval, for termination of payment services, temporary blocking or restriction of the provision of payment services, or refusal to perform a specific payment transaction only in such a way and to such an extent as to protect the content of Trisbee&#39;s verification procedure and in order to ensure the effectiveness thereof.

### **2.4. Payment Account Top Up and Performance of Payment Transactions from Payment Account in the Application**

**2.4.1.** To top up the Payment Account used for payments entered by the User in the Application, the User firstly needs to set the method of topping-up in the Application. The User may top up the Payment Account as follows:

(i) **by transfer from the User&#39;s bank account** held with the relevant banking institution, or

(ii) **by means of a selected (debit or credit) payment card** of the User issued for the User&#39;s bank account kept at their banking institution, or issued by another authorized issuer of payment cards.

In both cases, the User performs all steps of topping up the Payment Account directly in the Application, according to the method of topping up chosen thereby. Trisbee does not guarantee that all the above top up methods will always be accessible.

**2.4.2.** As soon as the amount selected by the User is credited to the Trisbee&#39;s bank account designated for the provision of payment services, Trisbee shall ensure that the relevant amount is credited to the User&#39;s Payment Account as soon as possible, no later than the next business day. Successful topping-up of the Payment Account is notified to the User directly in the Application and, at the same time, the balance of the Payment Account is increased in the Application. Upon topping up of the Payment Account, it is possible to perform payment transactions (up to the amount of the balance on the Payment Account).

**2.4.3.** The User may remit payments to the Merchant for the purchase of goods and services via the Application.

**2.4.4.** The User enters orders to execute a payment transaction in the Application by selecting the Merchant and by entering the amount of the transaction in the next step. Selection of a Merchant registered with Trisbee is available either by searching in the list of Merchants or by scanning the Merchant&#39;s QR code. After entering the amount of the payment, the User confirms their choice with the &quot;Pay&quot; button.

**2.4.5.** The User acknowledges that the Application may have set maximum limits for payments in accordance with the current provisions of the AML Act, or security limits set by Trisbee in order to prevent fraudulent payment transactions. These limits, if currently applied by Trisbee, are published on the website www.trisbee.com, and/or the User is informed thereof in the Application or by email.

**2.4.6.** After the User enters a payment order in the Application, the transaction is registered in the Trisbee system and within a few seconds the Application confirms successful acceptance of the payment order or non-acceptance of the payment order including justification thereof. Confirmation of a payment order acceptance is always designated with a unique transaction code.

**2.4.7.** Upon successful acceptance of a payment order, Trisbee shall always review the transaction for relevant provisions of the AML Act, ie. shall check whether it is a suspicious payment transaction, and shall verify, based on available information about the User and the payee or other information, whether it is a risky transaction in terms of possible fraud. After the payment transaction is verified and it is concluded that the transaction is not a suspicious or risky payment, Trisbee shall process the User&#39;s payment order by deducting the entered amount from the User&#39;s Payment Account and by sending this amount in favor of the selected Merchant according to Art. 2.4.8. hereof. Otherwise, ie. if the verification suggests that the payment transaction might be suspicious or risky, Trisbee shall proceed in accordance with Article 2.5. hereof.

**2.4.8. The payee is:**

(i) the Merchant to whom the User pays through the Application for offered goods or services.

In this case, upon the User&#39;s successful entering of a payment order in the Application, the Merchant is notified through notification in the Trisbee Payment Acceptance Application (the &quot;Business Application&quot;) of the registered payment in the entered amount. The Merchant receives the same unique transaction code that identifies the payment order in the User&#39;s Application. Trisbee sends the User&#39;s payment to the Merchant no later than the next working day after successful entering of the payment order by the User.

### **2.5. Suspicious and Risky Transactions**

**2.5.1.** In the event that Trisbee, based on verification of a payment transaction entered by the User in the Application (after entering a payment order) in accordance with Article 2.4.7. herein, concludes that the payment transaction is suspicious and/or risky (if there is a justified suspicion of fraud),

(i) **processing of the transaction is immediately suspended**

and, at the same time,

(ii) **Trisbee immediately contacts the User and/or the selected payee, requesting further information on the entered payment order and submission of supporting documents relating to the transaction.** Trisbee contacts these persons by phone and/or via SMS and/or email, and may choose any or all of these methods in order to do its best to reach the person contacted as quickly as possible.

**The reason** for verifying of such an entered payment order primarily consists in fulfillment of statutory obligations relating to Trisbee (as a mandatory payment institution) under the AML Act and in protection of legitimate interests of the company as an entrepreneur against fraud, whether committed against Trisbee or through Trisbee. **The purpose** of the verification is to obtain additional information and documents, on which Trisbee may base their decision on further processing of the entered payment order or rejection of the payment order.

**2.5.2.** The User acknowledges and understands that Trisbee is entitled to request the User and/or the selected payee to communicate thereto the facts and to provide thereto all relevant documents relating to the payment order entered by the User in the Application. Both the User and the selected payee are obliged to provide Trisbee with proper and timely cooperation. **Proper cooperation** means provision of complete, unbiased and truthful information and documents related to the verified payment transaction. **Timely cooperation** means cooperation provided without delay and no later than by the end of the 3rd working day after the day on which Trisbee demonstrably requested the cooperation of the person(s) concerned.

**2.5.3.** In the event that the User and the payee selected thereby jointly or separately remain out of contact or if they do not provide any information and documents or provide insufficient, distorted or misleading information and documents concerning the verified payment transaction by the deadline specified in the previous Art. 2.5.2. hereof, Trisbee may - as a result of such behavior - consider the verified payment transaction suspicious and risky. In such a case, Trisbee is **entitled to refuse processing of the payment order entered by the User.** The decision on refusal of the payment transaction mediation by Trisbee shall be notified without delay to the User and/or the intended payee. The amount entered by the User into the payment order and blocked by Trisbee for settlement of the payment transaction in question is not deducted from the User&#39;s Payment Account and is subsequently released for future payments by the User.

**2.5.4.** In situations where the User, or the payee selected thereby provide complete, unbiased and true information and documents relating to the verified payment transaction by the deadline according to Art. 2.5.2. hereof, Trisbee shall decide without undue delay, based on assessment of all facts and documents:

(i) **either to complete processing of the payment order entered by the User** so that the payment is sent or credited to the payee selected by the User in accordance with Article 2.4.8. hereof, if the doubts about the payment transaction are dispelled based on the information and documents provided;

or

(ii) **to refuse mediation of the payment transaction in question** if, based on the information and supporting documents provided, Trisbee concludes that the payment transaction is suspicious and/or risky. The decision on refusal of the payment transaction mediation by Trisbee shall be notified without delay to the User and/or the intended payee. The amount entered by the User into the payment order and blocked by Trisbee for settlement of the payment transaction in question is not deducted from the User&#39;s Payment Account and is subsequently released for future payments by the User.

### **2.6. Complaints about Entered Payment Order or Received Payment, Cancellations and Refunds**

**2.6.1.** Trisbee considers all the payment orders entered into the Application as the orders entered by the logged-in Application User or a person authorized thereby, unless the User specifically notifies Trisbee that this is not the case.

**2.6.2.** If the User thinks that a specific payment transaction made to the debit of the User&#39;s Payment Account was not entered in the Application by the User or a person authorized thereby, or that it was entered in the Application by the User or a person authorized thereby but for the benefit of another entity or in a different amount of payment than subsequently processed by Trisbee, the User may complain about the payment transaction with Trisbee.

**2.6.3.** The User is entitled to file a complaint about a specific payment transaction with Trisbee without undue delay after discovering the reason for the complaint, however no later than within 13 months from the date that the payment order was confirmed to the User as accepted in the Application, or - if the acceptance of the User&#39;s payment order was not confirmed in the Application and the transaction was debited to the User&#39;s Payment Account despite of that - within 13 months from the date of execution of the payment transaction.

**2.6.4**. Trisbee may require completion of a payment transaction claim form. If the form is unavailable the User&#39;s complaint shall include at least the following information:

- **identification data** (the User&#39;s name, surname, telephone number and email);
- **identification of the transaction** that the complaint relates to - indication of the unique transaction code (if received by the User), date and amount of the transaction;
- **the reason(s)** for filing of the complaint;
- **description of circumstances** relating to the claimed payment transaction;
- **what remedies the User seeks.**

The Users submit their complaint electronically by email to **support@trisbee.com** or in writing to the address: **Trisbee s.r.o., Kamenická 33, Prague 7 - Holešovice, postal code 170 00** , or electronically by personal databox - ID DS Trisbee s.r.o .: **ghwkp68**.

**2.6.5.** If a complaint submitted by the User contains all the data necessary for it to be checked by Trisbee (Art. 2.6.4. of these Terms and Conditions), Trisbee is obliged to settle the complaint **within 1 month from the day that the User&#39;s complaint was demonstrably delivered to Trisbee.** Trisbee always informs the User that their complaint was received by Trisbee and when, that it was registered and that it will be settled within 1 month. If a complaint filed by the User lacks data needed for verification of the claimed payment transaction, or if it is necessary that the User clarifies certain facts or submits relevant documents, Trisbee contacts the User in order to ensure completion of such facts and documents. In that case, the deadline for settling of a complaint may be adequately extended by the time period of waiting by Trisbee for communication of the required complementary facts and for documents indispensable for settlement of the complaint from the User. If the User does not communicate the complementary facts and/or does not provide indispensable documents to Trisbee within 1 month of a notice to do so delivered by Trisbee, without the User indicating the reason for such delay and requesting alternative deadline for communication and substantiation of complementary facts, Trisbee shall terminate the complaint procedure and shall notify the User thereof. Trisbee shall not be obliged to investigate a complaint if the claim notice does not indicate clearly who is filing the complaint and if the person concerned has not provided their contact details.

**2.6.6.** After examining all the facts and documents provided by the User in the filed complaint and/or the facts and documents from Trisbee&#39;s internal records, Trisbee shall decide on settlement of the complaint by concluding that the complaint is either:

(i) **justified** and therefore shall comply with the complaint, ie shall inform the User that their complaint is justified and shall immediately take all necessary actions leading to elimination of the claimed status of the payment transaction; these actions may vary depending on the nature of the complaint;

or

(ii) **unjustified** and therefore shall reject the complaint, ie shall inform the User that their complaint has been found unjustified and shall indicate substantial reasoning of the decision;

or

(iii) **partially justified** and therefore shall comply with the complaint to a certain extent, ie shall inform the User that their complaint is justified to a certain extent, shall specify the justified part of the complaint and shall immediately take all necessary actions leading to elimination of the reasonably claimed status of the payment transaction (specific actions may vary depending on the nature of the complaint). Trisbee shall further inform the claimant that the remainder of the complaint was found unjustified and shall indicate substantial reasoning of the decision.

**2.6.7.** The payee is entitled to proceed by analogy in accordance with Article 2.6.3. et seq. of these Terms and Conditions, if they assume that a payment made in favor of their bank account or Payment Account does not agree with the payment order entered by the User (payer) and notified thereto in the Application or in the Business Application, or if they have not received the payment entered by the User into the Application.

**2.6.8.** If the User requests **cancellation of a payment order entered thereby** where the transaction has not been processed by Trisbee yet, or **refund** of a payment that has already been processed and the payment amount has already been sent or credited to the payee, the User shall indicate the following information:

- **identification data** (the User&#39;s name, surname, telephone number and email);
- **identification of the transaction** that the cancellation/refund relates to - indication of the unique transaction code (if received by the User), date and amount of the transaction;
- **the reason(s) for requesting cancellation or refund.**

A request for cancellation of a payment transaction may only be submitted on the day of entering of the payment transaction in question by the User in favor of the payee; however, if Saturday, Sunday or public holiday follow the day according to the previous sentence, cancellation of the payment transaction may be requested by the end of the day followed a business day. A request for a refund may be submitted no later than 3 months from the date that the User submitted the payment order in question. The Users submit their requests for cancellation or refund electronically by email to **support@trisbee.com** or in writing to the address: **Trisbee s.r.o., Kamenická 33, Prague 7 - Holešovice, postal code 170 00** , or electronically by personal databox - ID DS Trisbee s.r.o .: **ghwkp68**.

**2.6.9.** In such a case, Trisbee is entitled to check the request for cancellation of the payment transaction or refund of the payment and verify the reasons thereof with the payee entered into the payment order. If the payee does not agree with the cancellation or refund in question and, at the same time, communicates the facts or provides documents whose initial assessment give cause for considering the payee&#39;s disagreement justified, Trisbee shall not cancel the payment transaction or refund the payment entered by the User. Furthermore, Trisbee shall not cancel the payment transaction or refund the payment on the User&#39;s request if the payee does not respond to the request for consent with cancellation of the payment transaction or refund of the payment within 3 days from the date that the request was sent thereto. In such a case, the User is advised to resolve the matter with the payee.

**2.6.10.** Trisbee shall cancel a payment transaction or refund a payment at the User&#39;s request only with the express consent of the payee. If the payee agrees with the cancellation of a specific payment transaction or with the refund of a payment, they shall be obliged, if the payment has already been credited to their bank account or Payment Account, to return the amount of the payment in question to the Trisbee&#39;s bank account which they received the payment from. Upon returning of the payment, Trisbee shall credit the amount of the payment in question back to the User&#39;s Payment Account, thus no later than the next business day after the payment returned by the payee was credited to the Trisbee&#39;s bank account.

### **2.7. Charges**

2.7.1. Trisbee does not charge any fees for the provided payment services to the User.

## **SECTION 3 - FURTHER RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS**

### **3.1. Liability**

**3.1.1.** The User is fully liable for any damage (both material and non-material) caused by their actions to Trisbee, persons related to Trisbee involved in mediation of payment services, or payees, if the User inflicts the damage:

(i) by intentional fraud;

(ii) by negligent conduct, including but not limited to insufficient security of the device in which the Application is installed or insufficient security of the Application so that a third party may perform payment transactions in the Application without authorization granted by the User;

(iii) by not informing Trisbee about facts concerning unauthorized payment transactions to a person other than the User, if the User finds out such facts or should have found them out if they behaved with reasonable diligence.

**3.1.2.** Trisbee is fully liable to the User for proper and timely mediation of any payment transaction successfully entered by the User (payment order), provided that the payment transaction is not deemed suspicious and/or risky. However, Tresbee **is not liable** for any damage that has occurred:

(i) due to circumstances which Trisbee could not have reasonably foreseen nor influenced (force majeure);

(ii) by fulfilling legal obligations imposed on Trisbee;

(iii) by actions of an entity other than Trisbee, which Trisbee could not have reasonably foreseen or influenced and therefore cannot be attributed to Trisbee - including but not limited to the actions of the banking institution responsible for clearing of the payment or of the telephone operator providing telephone and internet connection;

(iv) by actions of Trisbee constituting standard procedures of payment services mediation that the User must be aware of if they got acquainted with the content of these Terms and Conditions.

**3.1.3.** Trisbee is in no way responsible for the security, legality, quality or other properties of the goods or services purchased through payment by means of Trisbee. In the event that the price (or a part thereof) of goods and services paid originally through the Application is to be refunded on the basis of a complaint about the goods and/or services filed by the User with the payee, Trisbee may mediate refunding of the relevant amount to the User&#39;s Payment Account if thus agreed between the User and the payee, however only in the case of their mutual express consent and, at the same time, only if the payee returns the amount of the approved complaint (up to the amount of the original payment amount) to the Trisbee&#39;s bank account which it was originally credited to the payee from.

### **3.2. Notices**

**3.2.1.** All and any communications, notices or documents sent by Trisbee to the User shall be primarily served to the email address entered by the User in the Application, or to the email address notified thereby later and/or by a message in the Application.

### **3.8. Duration of the Agreement and Amendments to the Terms and Conditions**

**3.8.1.** By concluding the agreement according to Article 1.1. hereof, the User confirms to have been provided with all necessary pre-contractual information relevant for their decision-making about entering into an agreement with Trisbee before actual conclusion of the contractual relationship including information about Pilot; furthermore, the User confirms to have read these Terms and Conditions well in advance of the agreement conclusion, to understand the entire contents of the Terms and Conditions, to perceive the Terms and Conditions as specific and comprehensible, and that the individual rights and obligations arising from the contractual relationship with Trisbee are quite clear thereto.

**3.8.2.** This agreement between the User and Trisbee is concluded for a definite period, until the termination of the Pilot. In case Trisbee continues with provision of payment services to the User after the termination of the Pilot and the User intends to keep using payment services provided by Trisbee, it is deemed as a conclusion of a new agreement on the provision of payment services between Trisbee and the User under the terms and conditions which the User will be duly notified about before the termination of the Pilot and which will be published at Trisbee website [www.trisbee.com](http://www.trisbee.com/). Notwithstanding, both Trisbee and the User are entitled to terminate this agreement at any time by notifying the other party. Termination of the operation of the Trisbee payment system is also considered termination of this agreement.

**3.8.3.** The agreement is terminated by Trisbee or the User upon delivery of the notice to the other party. In the event that the User or Trisbee have any due and outstanding commitments to the other party, the parties are obliged to settle such commitments no later than 1 month from the date of the agreement termination.

**3.8.4.** Trisbee has the right to unilaterally amend these Terms and Conditions at any time. By expressing consent to the proposed amendments to the Terms and Conditions, or tacitly by the User not communicating to Trisbee within a predetermined period of time their disagreement with the proposed wording of the Terms and Conditions, the parties&#39; rights and obligations change in accordance with the new wording of the Terms and Conditions. Any amendment to the Terms and Conditions shall be binding for the User if Trisbee notified the User thereof in advance so that the User had the opportunity to get acquainted with the amendment. Notifying of an amendment to the Terms and Conditions means publishing of a notice on the Trisbee website, including publishing of the new version of the Terms and Conditions, and simultaneous notifying of the new Terms and Conditions in the Application and/or sending of a notice about the amendment to the Terms and Condition to the User&#39;s email box, including publishing of the new version of the Terms and Conditions. Any amendment to the Terms and Conditions shall take effect 2 months after the date of notification thereof, unless Trisbee specifies a later effect in the notification. If the User does not agree with an amendment to the Terms and Conditions, they may terminate the agreement at any time after notification of the amendment and before the day preceding the effective date of the amendment in question to the Terms and Conditions. Termination of the agreement for this reason in no way affects the obligation of both the User and Trisbee to settle the due and outstanding commitments to the other party within 1 month from the date of the agreement termination.

**3.8.5.** All rights and obligations arising from or in connection with the contractual relationship concluded between the User and Trisbee, the content of which is provided for under these Terms and Conditions, are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, regardless of where the access to the Trisbee payment service was made. Any disputes arising between the User and Trisbee will be resolved before the relevant courts of the Czech Republic.

**3.8.6.** If any of the provisions of these Terms and Conditions is or becomes invalid or ineffective, such invalid/ineffective provision shall be replaced by a provision the meaning of which is as close as possible to the purpose of the invalid or ineffective provision. Invalidity or ineffectiveness of any provision shall in no way affect the validity and effectiveness of the other provisions of the Terms and Conditions. Invalidity or ineffectiveness of a provision in a sole relation to a particular entity or group of entities shall in no way affect the validity and effectiveness of this provision in relation to other entities.

**3.8.7.** The User acknowledges that Trisbee is entitled to assign at any time its rights and obligations arising from the contractual relationship with the User to another entity. In such a case, Trisbee is obliged to notify the User of this fact in advance, and it is guaranteed that the User will retain all their rights and obligations towards the new entity. When this case happens, the User has the right to terminate the agreement by the effective date of the rights and obligations assignment to the new entity.

These Terms and Conditions enter into force and take effect on 1 February 2021.
