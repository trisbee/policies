The reason for that consists in the contractual relationship concluded between the Merchant and Trisbee constituting the Merchant a business partner of Trisbee; another reason may be the need for Trisbee to comply with obligations arising from contractual relationships with entities involved in the provision of the payment services (eg payment gateway provider) and, at the same time, general prevention of risks by Trisbee as an entrepreneur. Trisbee always requires communication and/or substantiation of only those facts that are strictly necessary for the above reasons; processing and archiving of all data on the Merchant always takes place in accordance with legal requirements and based on strictly set Trisbee internal rules.

**2.2.6.** Trisbee carries out identification and verification of further facts according to Article 2.2.3. and 2.2.4. of the Business Terms and Conditions without undue delay upon receiving the necessary data and documents from the Merchant. Once the identification and verification are completed, Trisbee shall decide whether the Merchant shall be approved or not. The Merchant is notified about the decision by email. The Merchant&#39;s approval is non-compulsory and is always at the discretion of Trisbee, according to the specific circumstances of each individual Merchant.

**2.2.7.** If the Merchant is approved, Trisbee immediately ensures the Merchant&#39;s registration in the Trisbee payment system. In the next step, the Merchant may start the Business Application according to Art. 2.3.3. of these Business Terms and Conditions.

**2.2.8.** Based on the new registration, Trisbee will generate the Merchant&#39;s unique QR code used for easy acceptance of payments from the Merchant&#39;s Customers and Users. If Trisbee and the Merchant agree so, the Merchant may have several QR codes assigned in the Trisbee payment system, for instance intended for the individual Merchant&#39;s establishments or with different predetermined payment amounts. Trisbee shall deliver the generated QR code to the Merchant as agreed thereby, usually by email.

**2.2.9.** Upon completion of the registration, the Merchant may be granted access to the Dashboard Business web application (see also 1.3.3. of the Business Terms and Conditions). The Dashboard Business contains information concerning payment transactions entered in favor of the Merchant, or other information concerning payment services provided to the Merchant by Trisbee. If the Merchant is granted access to the Dashboard Business, Trisbee usually provides the Merchant with a login link by email.

**2.2.10.** In justified cases, based on amendments to statutory requirements or as part of a regular or random inspection, Trisbee shall be entitled to perform identification and verification of the Merchant during the term of the contractual relationship.

**2.2.11.** Trisbee is entitled to decide about disapproval of the Merchant and, if necessary, on the temporary blocking, restriction or termination of the use of payment services in the event that:

(v) the provision of payment services to the Merchant, or the execution of a specific payment transaction entered by the User in favor of the Merchant is not compatible with the moral, generally human or business values ​​which Trisbee insists on adhering to.

The Merchant also confirms that they have read Trisbee Privacy Policy. The Merchant may decide whether to give consent with sending thereto Trisbee commercial communications and newsletters.

### **2.4. Acceptance of Payments by the Merchant**

**2.4.1.** The Merchant&#39;s Customer and the User may enter payment orders in favor of the Merchant, in particular using the User Application or another method offered by Trisbee to remit payments to the Merchant registered with Trisbee.

**2.4.2.** When paying with the Application, the Merchant&#39;s Customer or the User selects the specific Merchant either by searching in the list of Merchants in the Application or by scanning the QR code of the Merchant (see Article 2.2.8. of the Business Terms and Conditions). In the next step, they enter the amount of the payment and confirm their specifications in the User Application by pressing the &quot;Pay&quot; button. The Merchant&#39;s Customer or the User thus completes the payment order.

**2.4.3.** The Merchant acknowledges that the Merchant&#39;s Customers or the Users may have set maximum limits for payments in the Application in accordance with the current provisions of the AML Act, or security limits set by Trisbee in order to prevent fraudulent payment transactions.

**2.4.4.** After the Merchant&#39;s Customer or the User enters an order to make a payment in the User Application, the transaction is registered in the Trisbee system. The successful acceptance of the payment order is confirmed to the payer in the User Application and an assigned unique transaction code is delivered thereto. In such a case, the Merchant is notified in the Business Application of the payment registration and, at the same time, of the identical assigned unique transaction code.

**2.4.5.** The Merchant acknowledges that upon their notification of the payment registration in their favor, Trisbee shall always review the transaction for relevant provisions of the AML Act, ie Trisbee shall always check whether it is a suspicious payment transaction, and shall verify, based on available information about the payer and the Merchant or other information, whether it is a risky transaction in terms of possible fraud.

**2.4.6.** If the payment transaction is verified and it can be concluded that it is not a suspicious or risky transaction, Trisbee processes the payment order of the Merchant&#39;s Customer or the User and sends the relevant amount in favor of the Merchant&#39;s (verified) bank account no later than the next business day in accordance with Article 2.7. of these Business Terms and Conditions. Otherwise, ie if the verification suggests that the payment transaction might be suspicious and/or risky, Trisbee shall proceed in accordance with Article 2.5. hereof.

### **2.5. Suspicious and Risky Transactions**

**2.5.1.** In the event that Trisbee, based on verification of a payment transaction entered in favor of the Merchant in accordance with Article 2.4.5. herein, concludes that the payment transaction is suspicious and/or risky (if there is a justified suspicion of fraud),

(i) **processing of the transaction is immediately suspended**

and, at the same time,

(ii) **Trisbee immediately contacts the payer and/or the Merchant, requesting further information on the entered payment order and submission of supporting documents relating to the transaction.** Trisbee contacts these persons by phone and/or via SMS and/or email, and may choose any or all of these methods in order to do its best to reach the person contacted as quickly as possible.

**The reason** for verifying the entered payment order primarily consists in fulfillment of statutory obligations relating to Trisbee (as a mandatory payment institution) under the AML Act and in protection of legitimate interests of the company as an entrepreneur against fraud, whether committed against Trisbee or through Trisbee. **The purpose** of the verification is to obtain additional information and documents, on which Trisbee may base their decision on further processing of the entered payment order or rejection of the payment order.

**2.5.2.** The Merchant acknowledges and understands that Trisbee is entitled to request the payer and/or the Merchant to communicate to Trisbee the facts and to provide Trisbee with all relevant documents relating to the payment order entered by the payer in the User Application.

In such a case, Trisbee is **entitled to refuse processing of the payment order entered by the payer.** The decision on refusal of the payment transaction mediation by Trisbee shall be notified without delay to the payer and/or the Merchant. In such a case the payment shall not be remitted to the Merchant.

**2.5.4.** In situations where the payer, or the Merchant provide complete, unbiased and true information and documents relating to the verified payment transaction by the deadline according to Art. 2.5.2. hereof, Trisbee shall decide without undue delay, based on assessment of all facts and documents:

(i) **to complete processing of the payment order entered by** the payer so that the payment is remitted to the Merchant in accordance with Article 2.4.6. hereof, if the doubts about the payment transaction are dispelled based on the information and documents provided;

or

(ii) **to refuse mediation of the payment transaction in question** if, based on the information and supporting documents provided, Trisbee concludes that the payment transaction is suspicious and/or risky. The decision on refusal of the payment transaction mediation by Trisbee shall be notified without delay to the payer and/or the Merchant. In such a case the payment shall not be remitted to the Merchant.

If a complaint filed by the Merchant lacks data needed for verification of the claimed payment transaction, or if it is necessary that the Merchant clarifies certain facts or submits relevant documents, Trisbee contacts the Merchant in order to ensure completion of such facts and documents. In that case, the deadline for settling of a complaint may be adequately extended by the time period of waiting by Trisbee for communication of the required complementary facts and for documents indispensable for settlement of the complaint from the Merchant. If the Merchant does not communicate the complementary facts and/or does not provide indispensable documents to Trisbee within 1 month of a notice for completion delivered by Trisbee, without indicating the reason for such a delay and for requesting alternative deadline for communication and substantiation of complementary facts, Trisbee shall terminate the complaint procedure and shall notify the Merchant thereof. Trisbee shall not be obliged to investigate a complaint if the claim notice does not indicate clearly who is filing the complaint and if the person concerned has not provided their contact details.

**2.6.5.** After examining all the facts and documents provided by the Merchant in the filed complaint and/or the facts and documents from Trisbee&#39;s internal records, Trisbee shall decide on settlement of the complaint by concluding that the complaint is either:

(i) **justified** and therefore shall comply with the complaint, ie shall inform the Merchant that their complaint is justified and shall immediately take all necessary actions leading to elimination of the claimed status of the payment transaction; these actions may vary depending on the nature of the complaint;

or

(ii) **unjustified** and therefore shall reject the complaint, ie shall inform the Merchant that their complaint has been found unjustified and shall indicate substantial reasoning of the decision;

or

(iii) **partially justified** and therefore shall comply with the complaint to a certain extent, ie shall inform the Merchant that their complaint is justified to a certain extent, shall specify the justified part of the complaint and shall immediately take all necessary actions leading to elimination of the reasonably claimed status of the payment transaction (specific actions may vary depending on the nature of the complaint).

**2.6.7.** Trisbee shall cancel a payment transaction or refund a payment at the Merchant&#39;s request only with the express consent of the payer.

    - **on their website, social networks and wherever the Merchant offers its goods or services** , if the merchant is the operator of the e-sale of goods or services in question.

- Trisbee will provide the Merchant with all necessary materials used to indicate Trisbee payment services, in the form of stickers, printed and electronic QR codes, banners, etc.

Only if, within the set time limit, the deficiencies are not rectified by the Merchant, their actions are not explained in any way or the explanation is insufficient or does not justify the Merchant&#39;s actions leading to the breach of their obligations, Trisbee will terminate provision of payment services to the Merchant and will notify the Merchant of this decision. The decision is always at the discretion of Trisbee.

**3.1.1.** The merchant is fully liable for any damage (both material and non-material) caused by their actions to Trisbee, persons related to Trisbee involved in mediation of payment services, or the Merchant&#39;s Customers and Users, if the Merchant inflicts the damage:

(i) by intentional fraud;

(ii) by negligent conduct, including but not limited to insufficient security of the device in which the Business Application is installed so that a third party may access information on payment transactions registered in the Business Application without authorization granted by the Merchant;

### **3.9. Duration of the Agreement and Amendments to the Terms and Conditions**

**3.9.1.** By concluding the agreement according to Article 1.1. hereof, the Merchant confirms to have been provided with all necessary information relevant for their decision-making about entering into an agreement with Trisbee before actual conclusion of the contractual relationship; furthermore, the Merchant confirms to have read these Business Terms and Conditions in advance of the agreement conclusion, to understand the entire contents of the Business Terms and Conditions, to perceive the Business Terms and Conditions as specific and comprehensible, and that the individual rights and obligations arising from the contractual relationship with Trisbee are entirely clear thereto.

**3.9.2.** The agreement between the Merchant and Trisbee is concluded for an indefinite period. Both Trisbee and the Merchant are entitled to terminate the agreement at any time by notifying the other party. The notice period is 1 month. Termination of the operation of the Trisbee payment system is also considered termination of the Agreement.

**3.9.3.** The notice period according to Article 3.9.2. of the Business Terms and Conditions starts from the day following the delivery of the notice to the other contracting party and ends after 1 month. In the event that the Merchant or Trisbee have any due and outstanding commitments to the other party, the parties are obliged to settle such commitments no later than 1 month from the date of the agreement termination.

**3.9.4.** Trisbee has the right to unilaterally amend these Business Terms and Conditions at any time. By expressing consent to the proposed amendments to the Business Terms and Conditions, or tacitly by the Merchant not communicating to Trisbee within a predetermined period of time their disagreement with the proposed wording of the Business Terms and Conditions, the parties&#39; rights and obligations change in accordance with the new wording of the Business Terms and Conditions. Any amendment to the Business Terms and Conditions shall be binding for the Merchant if Trisbee notified the Merchant thereof in advance so that the Merchant had the opportunity to get acquainted with the amendment. Notifying of an amendment to the Terms and Conditions means publishing of a notice on the Trisbee website, including publishing of the new version of the Terms and Conditions, and simultaneous notifying of the new Terms and Conditions in the Business Application, in the Dashboard Business and/or sending of a notice about the amendment to the Business Terms and Condition to the Merchant&#39;s email box, including publishing of the new version of the Business Terms and Conditions. Any amendment to the Business Terms and Conditions shall take effect 1 month after the date of notification thereof, unless Trisbee specifies a later effect in the notification. If the Merchant does not agree with an amendment to the Business Terms and Conditions, they may terminate the agreement at any time after notification of the amendment and before the day preceding the effective date of the amendment in question to the Business Terms and Conditions. No change to the Business Terms and Conditions is effective for the Merchant during the notice period. Termination of the agreement for this reason nevertheless in no way affects the obligation of both the Merchant and Trisbee to settle the due and outstanding commitments to the other party within 1 month from the date of the agreement termination.

**3.9.5.** All rights and obligations arising from or in connection with the contractual relationship concluded between the Merchant and Trisbee, the content of which is provided for under these Business Terms and Conditions, are governed by the laws of the Czech Republic, regardless of where the access to the Trisbee payment service was made. Any disputes arising between the Merchant and Trisbee will be resolved before the relevant courts of the Czech Republic.

**3.9.6.** If any of the provisions of the Business Terms and Conditions is or becomes invalid or ineffective, such invalid/ineffective provision shall be replaced by a provision the meaning of which is as close as possible to the economic purpose of the invalid or ineffective provision. Invalidity or ineffectiveness of any provision shall in no way affect the validity and effectiveness of the other provisions hereof. Invalidity or ineffectiveness of a provision in a sole relation to a particular entity or group of entities shall in no way affect the validity and effectiveness of this provision in relation to other entities.

**3.9.7.** The Merchant acknowledges that Trisbee is entitled to assign at any time its rights and obligations arising from the contractual relationship with the Merchant to another entity. In such a case, Trisbee is obliged to notify the Merchant of this fact in advance, and it is guaranteed that the Merchant will retain all their rights and obligations towards the new entity. When this case happens, the Merchant has the right to terminate the agreement by the effective date of the rights and obligations assignment to the new entity.

These Terms and Conditions enter into force and take effect on 1 February 2021.
