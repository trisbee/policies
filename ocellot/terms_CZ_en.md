**2.1.2.**	By entering into the Agreement, Trisbee grants the Merchant a non-exclusive, non-transferable and paid License, i.e. the right to use Ocellot for the agreed period of time, in compliance with these Terms and Conditions.

**2.1.6.** 	The Merchant acknowledges that the computer program, graphics, photographs, texts and other elements of Ocellot, if any, are individually or as a whole protected by copyright as works of authorship.
