## (1) What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files placed in the memory of your browser or device while browsing a website. They are stored in your browser by the websites you visit. They are necessary for some website features, such as logging in. Cookies also allow a website or app to remember various settings such as language, font and other options you have chosen to view the site.

Our website uses different types of cookies. Some cookies that appear on our site are placed by third party services.

Cookies can be divided into two categories **according to their durability**:
**Short-term (session cookies)** remain on your browser or device until you close your browser or app, after which they are deleted.
**Persistent cookies** remain stored in your browser or device for a long time (depending on your browser settings and the settings of the cookies themselves) or until you delete them manually. These cookies can be used to identify the user's device when the web browser or application is restarted. In any case, cookies do not affect the technical use of your device and do not contain viruses.

Cookies can be divided into two categories depending on **who creates and processes them**:
**First party cookies** are created directly by a website or scripts on the same domain. These most often serve to ensure the basic functionalities of a website or application.
**Third party cookies** are most often those of advertising systems, social network widgets or embedded videos.

## (2) What cookies do we use?

**We mainly use technical cookies (first-party, short-term)** that are necessary to ensure the elementary functionalities of websites, applications or other services, such as saving of the selected language version.
 
We also use **analytical and preference cookies and cookies to better target marketing offers**. These include **Google tools such as Google Analytics, Google Adwords, Google Tag Manager (first party, long term)** - we use these tools to collect data and generate statistics about user behaviour so that we can better tailor our services to you. The data is considered in the form of an aggregate and therefore in an anonymous form that does not allow you to be identified. You can use the settings directly in your browser to change your cookie storage settings.

You can therefore use the website in a mode that does not allow the collection of data about your behaviour. You have the right to object to the collection of data on the basis of our legitimate interest by emailing support@trisbee.com.

We will deal with your objection without undue delay, not later than in 1 month. In exceptional cases, in particular due to the complexity of your request, we are entitled to extend this period by another two months. We would inform you of any such extension, including the justification for it.
However, in case you object to the processing of technical cookies necessary for the website functionality, we cannot guarantee full functionality and compatibility of our website.

**We never use cookies to identify you personally and we never place sensitive or personal data in cookies.**

## (3) Why do we process cookies?

1. **Full functionality of the use of our website** - some cookies are necessary to ensure the full functionality of the use of our website (so-called technical cookies), e.g. for site navigation.
2. **Making our website easier to browse and improving the services we provide** - some cookies are not strictly necessary for the full website functionality, but their use improves the user experience and makes browsing the website more enjoyable (preference cookies). Thanks to another group of cookies (analytical cookies) we measure traffic and make (anonymous) statistics about your behaviour on the website. This allows us to monitor and improve the functionality and security of our website, app and other services.
3. **Customization of advertising and marketing messages** - through the use of marketing cookies, we can customize the advertising or marketing messages displayed to make them relevant to you and thus more valuable to advertisers and advertising publishers.

To prevent unauthorized access to our cookies and similar technologies, we have security measures in place wherever necessary. A unique identifier ensures that only we and/or authorized service providers have access to cookie data.

## (4) How to adjust the use of cookies?

You can delete all cookies previously stored on your device. Most browsers also offer the option to block cookies from being placed on your device. In this case, however, please be aware that blocking or disabling cookies for this purpose may have a negative impact on your overall web browsing experience. For detailed information about the cookie storage settings on your browser or device, please visit the website of your specific browser provider.

## (5) How long will we process the data?
The individual storage and processing periods of cookies are governed by the terms and conditions of the particular service used (see section 6 below). You can withdraw your consent to the use of cookies at any time by changing your browser settings or by contacting us at support@trisbee.com.
